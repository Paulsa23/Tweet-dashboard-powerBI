**Project Overview**

*This project analyzes a tweet dataset containing the following fields:
textID
Text
Selected Text
Sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)
Using this dataset, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to uncover sentiment patterns and insights from tweets.*

**Data Preparation**

*Added two new calculated columns:
Tweet Length – measures the length of each tweet.
Selected Text Length – measures the portion of the tweet used  responsible for sentiment*

**Dashboard Visualizations**

*Sentiment Distribution (Pie Chart): Shows the overall composition of tweets by sentiment (positive, neutral, negative).
Tweet Length by Sentiment (Bar Chart): Helps identify whether longer tweets tend to have a specific sentiment type.
Detailed Table View: Provides a closer look at tweets
Sentiment Analysis Fraction (Bar Chart): Displays the proportion of each tweet that was actually used for sentiment classification.*

**Key Takeaways**

*Clear visualization of sentiment distribution across the dataset.
Insights into how tweet length correlates with sentiment.
Ability to inspect individual tweets for detailed sentiment understanding.*
